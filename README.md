# ut-gaster-fight
This is an Undertale fan game made made with SFML, based in a single battle.

# How to play?

You can use the arrows to move around the border and to go through menu options. You may press Z to select a menu option and X to return.

If you die, you can restart by pressing Z in the game over screen.

# Attack types.

Just like in Undertale, there is blue and orange attacks, the logic behind them is simple:

**Blue attacks** - You may not move and you won't get damage.</br>
**Orange attacks** - You must keep moving, otherwise you will get damage.

However, take into account that the default attack from blasters (which is not blue or orange) will damage you, whether you are moving or not, so avoid them.

# Menu options:

### Fight.
This option allows you to attack the enemy (which is self-explanatory by its name). However, you will miss all attacks on this enemy, because of their nature. What matters in this battle is to survive until the end.

### Act.
At the moment, only the **check** option is available upon clicking this menu, which allows you to check the enemy's attack and defense.

### Item.
By clicking this menu, you will be given heal item options you can select (which is only 1 item at the moment).

### Mercy
Although this menu is available, you can't use mercy on this enemy. However, if you click it, you will be given the option of skipping your turn. 

# Plans for the future.

As you can see, the menus provide only one option each, however that may be changed in the future and more options (as well as items) could be implemented. Also, a proper game over screen may be implemented (something similar to the actual game).
